# Overview

One visualization option I didn’t mention in my [previous post](/blog/display-intermediate-results-and-visualization-geo) is **Guide Geometry**. HDAs allow you to select a node in your asset and have it show up in the viewport as a wireframe. Sometimes this is perfect and it’s all you need, other times it can be a bit limiting. That being said, here’s how you can use it!

Check out the video and hipfile above!

<!-- # Example Setup
