I'm a Houdini FX TD currently working at [WētāFX](https://wetafx.co.nz) in Wellington 🇳🇿. Before that, I spent a few years at [The Mill](https://themill.com) working on various commercial projects.

I enjoy creating high quality FX elements, as well as tool-building and pipeline development.

You can find my full resume [here](resume.pdf).
